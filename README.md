Purpose of project is to import json files to MongoDB, and use this information to manipulate and build DataFrames in Jupyter Notebook. I have been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate ratings given by the UK Food Standards Agency.

To begin, I imported the establishments.json file to MongoDB on my MAC, using the code 








Lastly, we took these CSV files and created tables through PostgreSQL. For the ERD file containing information on primary and foreign keys, see file labeled 'ERD Image.png'.

To create tables through PostgreSQL, visit file labeled 'crowdfunding_db_schema.sql'. Using this schema, we created four tables and succesfully imported the coresponding CSV files to their table.

To see the success of the imports, we used SELECT statements on each table to show information. See files labeled 'select_campaign screenshot.png', 'select_category screenshot.png', 'select_contacts screenshot.png', and 'select_subcategory screenshot.png'.
